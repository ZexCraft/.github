## Introduction

NFT Creators generally get a huge income from the mint fee the buyers pay during the mint period. Post mint, there is nothing new or exciting in the NFT collection and the creator gets a small income from the royalty of the NFT sales. Art belongs to the world. And every single individual should be a part of the NFT art if they hold it. But is there a way for these holders to be a part of something more interesting?

## Product Description

Introducing ZexNFTs, NFT holders can breed with other NFTs and form relationships to create AI generated children NFTs with unique traits, rarity and utility. On entering ZexCraft, Each NFT Holder creates an ERC6551 Account aka. NFT owned Account which would be the NFT's ethereum address. The NFT Holder can either choose to breed with NFTs they own or mate with other NFT holders or NFT Holders that are interested to form a relationships with their NFT and create unique AI generated children.


By forming a relationship, the pair forms a new family tree(BAYC/Azuki, Azuki/BEANS or PUNKS/BAYC) or they could be a part of an existing family tree. Only NFTs belonging to two collections that are bred with in the root. can breed with each other creating a special community. For instance, if the root pair is a BAYC and a Asuki. Their children can only breed with another BAYC or a Asuki preserving the family integrity. The Root family can set custom conditions such as relationship fee(Fee to be a part of the family tree), rarity criteria, attributes criteria etc.
