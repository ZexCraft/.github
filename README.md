## Introduction

NFT Creators generally get a huge income from the mint fee the buyers pay during the mint period. Post mint, there is nothing new or exciting in the NFT collection and the creator gets a small income from the royalty of the NFT sales. Art belongs to the world. And every single individual should be a part of the NFT art if they hold it. But is there a way for these holders to be a part of something more interesting?
